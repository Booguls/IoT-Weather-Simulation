# Machine Learning in IoT Fault Tolerance
## This repository holds the Node-RED IoT network simulation which aims to asses the use of machine learning models to act as a temporary virtual replacement of offline IoT devices. 
## Please refer to the "Simulation Visualization with Steps" pdf file to understand the project in greater detail

By examining previous attempts to improve the reliability of IoT networks, this project proposes the use of machine learning techniques to closely approximate live data while IoT devices are offline. In this repository you will find the raw JSON code of the simulation, example executions,  the research paper written by me which goes into detail of the project and its related papers, and example images which demonstrate how the devices are simulated, what information is simulated and demonstrates how machine learning models are used.
