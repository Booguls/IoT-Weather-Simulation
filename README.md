# IoT-Weather-Simulation
## This repository holds the Node-RED IoT network simulation which aims to asses the use of machine learning models to predict weather. 

By examining previous attempts to improve the reliability of IoT networks, this project proposes the use of machine learning techniques to closely approximate live data while IoT devices are offline. In this repository you will find the raw JSON code of the simulation, example executions, and the research paper written by me which goes into detail of the project and its related papers.
